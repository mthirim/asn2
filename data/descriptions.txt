Breadth-Social Sciences.
This course is an examination of urban design as a discipline that involves the environmental, aesthetic, social, economic, geographic, ecological, historical, political, and cultural aspects of the built environment. The importance of creative design, the interrelationship between the spatial organization of a city, its efficient delivery of services, the social, cultural and economic considerations of the public realm, as well as the process of change in our pluralistic society will all be considered.
This course is an introduction to the anthropological and sociological study of complex urban societies in comparative perspective. It includes study of anthropological and sociological approaches to urbanization, the nature of the city as a social system, and urban communities and cultures.
The focus of this course is the evolving relationship between state interventions into the city, and dynamics of urban development. The class emphasizes the historical context to urban planning and policy, with particular reference to the Canadian city.
Examines the forces that have created and perpetuated urban social inequality, along with its political, economic, and cultural impact on cities. Explores the social movements, planning efforts, and policy initiatives that have tackled urban poverty and social exclusion in the struggle to create just cities.
The aim of this course is to develop a perspective on the study of urbanization by applying systematic approaches to specific regional and case contexts. Major theoretical and conceptual themes will be reviewed. Some emphasis will be placed upon the Canadian experience in order to develop a common ground among members of the course and some emphasis will be also placed upon the United States and Western Europe because of the dominance of those collective urban experiences and literatures. However, members of the course will be expected to develop an interest in a particular region, assemble a personal bibliography and report to the class on their enquiries. The list of references given to the class may be perused for selected items to initiate this personal work. Emphasis will be placed upon individual and/or participatory research.
In this course, we begin to answer the question: what does the idea of sustainable development mean for cities? Using case studies from Vancouver and around the world, we will seek to understand how urban sustainable development innovations are developed, designed, and implemented. Special attention will be paid to the importance of sustainable development linkages between urban issues related to economic development, social justice, and environmental conservation and protection.
This course is intended to confront students with many of the current administrative, policy, inter-governmental and political challenges of local/urban/city-regional government in the 21st century. It will enable students to critically evaluate the varied nature and development of urban and metropolitan governance through an assessment of differing city-regional forms and responsibilities. The primary emphasis is on: social, economic and political sustainability; ethnic, gender and ecological re-definitions of the city; urban fiscal constraints and possibilities; urban governance and local democracy; intergovernmental challenges; urban responses to and re-definitions of re-globalization; case studies of agenda setting and other policy cycle stages. The primary seminar focus is on urban Canada but comparative cases will be drawn from the United States, the EU, Asia and other jurisdictions.
Students will critically evaluate and apply various approaches and concepts in assessing the phenomenon of the global city. Assessment of current Canadian and comparative cases and settings provides a basis for this examination, as does the various stages of the policy cycle.
Explores the relationships between mobility, economic activity, and social interaction that influence urban development. Topics considered will include the spatial dynamics underlying travel behavior, the vehicle and infrastructure technology used in meeting mobility needs, the organizations that deliver transportation services and the public policies that govern an urban transportation system.
Examination of the roles of housing in an urban society, the evolution of urban housing policy in Canada, the policies that shape the existing housing system, and proposals for modifying housing policies and programs. The role of affordable housing as an essential component of a sustainable community will be emphasized.
Offers a tip-to-all approach to researching urban public policy problems, from imagining projects, to gathering interpreting data and presenting findings to the public. The emphasis of this program is for students to be able to understand the work of others and design their own studies. In addition to this, students are trained in how to apply descriptive statistics such as means, measures of spread and cross-tabulation. Students wishing to deepen their quantitative skills, such as multivariate, qualitative or spatial analysis, will be encouraged to take advanced programs offered in affiliated departments.
Reviews several traditional and contemporary theories of urban economic development, exploring the historical context, content and policy implications of each.
Examines theories of public management in an urban context; how governments allocate resources, distribute income and regulate public enterprise in both pure and applied contexts. Taking a 'champion vs. challenger' approach, the first segment of the course describes in detail the dominant theory in public management - new public management - and then contrasts this theory with others common to the discipline including traditional approaches, cultural theory, representative bureaucracy and new institutionalism. The theory is illustrated using examples from the municipalities within the Greater Vancouver Regional District and other Canadian and international cities.
The focus of this course is the distribution of health status within urban centers in Canada, and related health policy developments. The course will emphasize the systematic nature of health status distribution, the historical pattern of health inequality, emerging analyses of the role of 'place' in shaping health patterns, housing and health, and attempts to reformulate social policy in urban contexts to address 'social determinants' of health inequality in Canada.
The city has long been a subject of, and site for, cultural reflection. This course recognizes that cultural and political ideas are not context-free. The course focuses on modern and postmodern thought and their relation to the evolving city.
